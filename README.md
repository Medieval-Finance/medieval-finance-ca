# Medieval Finance

## Overview

Medieval Finance is an algorithmic token protocol on the Sonic blockchain, focused on **stability**. We are reimagining the original "Tomb Finance" model with strategic enhancements for better sustainability, improved yield, and optimal yield utilization.

The $SHIELD token forms the foundation of the Medieval protocol with its primary objective being to maintain a stable peg to $scUSD, offering the highest yields on the Sonic blockchain while leveraging Sonic's native assets.

## Protocol Dynamics

The protocol dynamically adjusts the supply of $SHIELD based on:
- Market conditions
- Supply & demand factors
- Market sentiment

This mechanism keeps the price stable and in line with $scUSD, while rewarding users and participants.

## Token Model

Medieval Finance operates on a two-token model:

* **Shield ($SHIELD)** - The algorithmic token pegged to $scUSD
* **Medieval Shares ($KNIGHT)** - The governance and value accrual token

## Strategic Partnerships

We are strategic supporters of SwapX and have carefully designed $SHIELD to enhance its utility within the Sonic ecosystem. By joining forces with ecosystem powerhouses like **Rings Protocol, SwapX, and ICHI** vaults, we're building one of the strongest foundations ever seen in an algorithmic stablecoin protocol.

## The Team

Medieval Finance was founded by a group of "OGs" from the fast-evolving DeFi landscape with over 6 years of experience dating back to the first DeFi applications on Ethereum. Our extensive experience has allowed us to:

- Learn from the mistakes of predecessors
- Navigate every corner of the DeFi landscape
- Carefully craft Medieval Finance with sustainability in mind

## Why $scUSD Peg?

Unlike most current algorithmic stablecoins on Sonic pegging to $S or $OS, we utilize the strength of the Rings Protocol by pegging to $scUSD. Rings is a yield-bearing stablecoin protocol built on Veda BoringVaults that:

- Draws inspiration from Blast's **native yield** concept
- Implements Solidly's ve (3,3) model
- Opens doors to solidify our foundation
- Allows strategic use of liquidity to earn more yield
- Increases Sonic multiplier score points

## Core Principles

Our main focus is built around three core principles:

1. **Sustainability** - Creating systems that can thrive in various market conditions
2. **Security** - Implementing robust security measures to protect user assets
3. **Transparency** - Maintaining full transparency with our community

## Risk Warning

**WARNING: While we aim to provide opportunities and favorable yield strategies, THIS IS AN EXPERIMENT. THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. Everyone should be aware of the risks before investing or interacting with an experimental protocol like this.**
